## About

This mobile application is built using SwiftUI and Xcode 12.4 for iOS devices.

If attempting to run this code on future versions of Swift, Xcode, or iOS some additional work may be required to get this code running smoothly.

## Quick Start

The following steps will guide you through the process of running this application on your local machine, and device.

1. Checkout this repository
2. Open `iOSTechChallenge.xcodeproj` with Xcode
3. Go to the project settings, and change the code signing team to your own
4. Wait for the Swift Packages to download if not.

Code signing settings are left at automatic here for simplicity, you can set these to manual if needed but these steps will not take you through that process.

8. Ensure the iPhone has development mode enabled, from the Devices & Simulators window: <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd>
